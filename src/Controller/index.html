<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong> is a simple simlation program, based on the Lecture "Einführung in die Geoinformatik" held by Prof. Dr. Christian Kray at University Münster, Germany.
This program aims to give an easy introduction to "grid-based Agent Based Simulations".

<br>
<br>

<strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong> let's you choose a gridsize for the "Meadow", define the number of Sheeps and Wolves to place on the Meadow. It let's you also define a probability how likely it is, that agents can create offsprings.
At last, you are able to look at distributions of the energy level of all agents, calculated at each timestep.

<h2>How to use this program</h2>

<strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong> provides different "Tabs" with options:

<h3>Console</h3>

The "Console"-Tab let's you change basic simulation properties like the <i>Seed</i>, <i>Step-Delay</i> and <i>Stop/Pause-Criteria</i>. 
If you want to run the same simulation over and over again, you have to use the same <i>Seed</i> every time and also uncheck the option "Increment Seed on Stop".
<br>
The <i>Step-Delay</i> defines how many seconds it takes to perform a step of the simulation. The larger this number gets, the more time it takes to perform a simulation step.

<h3>Displays</h3>

THe "Displays"-Tab lists all "Displays" provided by <strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong>. 
A "Display" is a Window where graphical elements of the simulation (like the "Meadow") are stored. Here you have the option to "show" or "hide" those Displays.

<h3>Inspectors</h3>

Currently not supported.

<h3>Model</h3>

The "Model"-Tab provides options to change the "Model Parameters". Detailed information about the "Model Parameters" are provided in <strong>Model Parameters</strong>.

<h2>Model Parameters</h2>

<strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong> provides some parameters for you to edit. Those parameters change the behavior of the simulation (like gridsize, reproducibility of agents, etc.).
<strong>Sheepsmeadow</strong> also provides "read-only" parameters like <i>WolfEnergyDistribution</i> and <i>SheepEnergyDistribution</i>.

<h3>GridSize</h3>

The <i>GridSize</i> defines the area of the "Meadow". This is a raster of size N x N. The Gridsize is a threshold for how many agents can be placed on the "Meadow" (e.g. with a Gridsize of 5, only 5*5=25 agents can be placed).

<h3>ReproductionDelay</h3>

The <i>ReproductionDelay</i> defines the number of simulation steps, an agent that has been part of a reproduction event needs to wait, until it can reproduce again.

<h3>SheepEnergyDistribution</h3>

Using the small "magnifying lens" next to this parameter in the "Model"-Tab, you can find the option "Make Histogram". Click this, and a window with the corresponding histogram will pop up.

<h3>SheepFertillityRate</h3>

The <i>SheepFertillityRate</i> defines how likely it is, that two sheeps produce an offspring in a reproduction event. "1" means the reproduction will always be sucessful and "0" means the two sheep can't reproduce.

<h3>Wolves</h3>

<i>Wolves</i> defines, how many wolves should be placed on the "Meadow". You can only places as many wolves, as the the gridsize allows.

<h3>WolfEnergyDistribution</h3>

Using the small "magnifying lens" next to this parameter in the "Model"-Tab, you can find the option "Make Histogram". Click this, and a window with the corresponding histogram will pop up.

<h3>WolfFertilityRate</h3>

The <i>WolfFertillityRate</i> defines how likely it is, that two wolves produce an offspring in a reproduction event. "1" means the reproduction will always be sucessful and "0" means the two wolve can't reproduce.

<h3>Sheep</h3>

<i>Sheep</i> defines, how many sheep should be placed on the "Meadow". You can only places as many sheep, as the the gridsize allows.
